You may also know, if you've read\nthrough the documentation, that you can also use other programming languages\nusing an RPC server. But what you may not have known, is that you can also use\nany language that compiles to a dynamic library using the C ABI of your\noperating system.\nThe Idea\nIf you've spent any amount of time playing around in neovim, you've definitely\ncome across Lua as a programming language. You may have heard that Lua is a\nlanguage designed to allow more or less easy interoperability with C. This\nallows us to write with any language that can be compiled to a .so or .dll.\nMy choice of language was Rust, as there are already some handy tools that work\nfor this.\nIn order to have it work, we just need to compile a Rust library to a C dynamic\nlibrary, put it in the lua folder of our plug-in, and we should be good to go!\nThe Project\nA wise man once told me, \"If it's useless, it's absolutely necessary\".\nFollowing this precept, we will build the most necessary neovim plug-in out\nthere: a morse interpreter. This is a good reason to use Rust, as there is no\ngood cross-platform audio library for lua, that doesn't require LuaRocks.\nCargo setup\nIn order to be able to communicate with neovim, Rust will need to do two\nthings:\n\nUnderstand Lua\nLearn the neovim API\n\nWe could definitely use a crate like mlua and\nwrite our own wrappers for that, but it would be tedious. Luckily, somebody\nelse already did all the heavy lifting and wrote\nnvim-oxi, which we will use here. We will also\nuse rodio for the audio processing, to play our files\nas morse beeps. Our Cargo.toml thus looks like this:\n[package]\nname = \"morse\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n\n[dependencies]\nnvim-oxi = { version = \"0.3.0\", features = [\"neovim-0-9\"] }\nrodio = \"0.17.1\"\n\nConnecting to neovim through Rust\nUsing nvim-oxi, our lib entry point will need some special care. First, obviously,\nit must be called the same as our plug-in. But it also needs to be flagged to the\ncompiler that it's a neovim module. Following the classical\nthe-plug-in-is-hidden-behind-a-setup-function approach, our entry point could look like this:\nuse nvim_oxi::{self as oxi, api::Buffer, Object, Dictionary, Function};\n\n#[oxi::module]\nfn morse() -&gt; oxi::Result&lt;Dictionary&gt; {\n    Ok(Dictionary::from_iter([\n        (\"setup\", Function::from_fn(setup)),\n    ]))\n}\n\nThe Function struct allows for easy conversion between Rust functions and functions\nthat Lua can see.\nWe will need a struct to hold the configuration info, which our setup function shall\nset. For now this struct will only hold the frequency of our beeps:\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)]\nstruct Config {\n    freq: f32,\n}\n\nfn setup(freq: f32) -&gt; oxi::Result&lt;Dictionary&gt;  {\n    let conf = Config{\n        freq,\n    };\n\n    Ok(Dictionary::from_iter([\n        (\"beep\", Object::from(Function::from_fn(move |t| {beep(t,conf)}))),\n        (\"convert\", Object::from(Function::from_fn(move |b| {convert(b,conf)}))),\n    ]))\n}\n\nWe move a copy of this config into closures owned by the Function objects returned\nby our config. This may not be the most efficient way to do things, but it's the\nmemory-safest way I could think of, without needing runtime initialised static variables.\nPlaying Audio\nAs said above, we will use the rodio crate to hear our dits and dahs. To make a simple\nsine beep:\nuse rodio::{\n    source::{SineWave, Source},\n    OutputStream,\n    Sink\n};\nuse std::{\n    time::Duration,\n    thread::sleep,\n    convert::Infallible\n};\n\nfn beep(time: f32, conf: Config) -&gt; Result&lt;(),Infallible&gt; {\n    let (_stream, stream_handle) = OutputStream::try_default().unwrap();\n    let sink = Sink::try_new(&amp;stream_handle).unwrap();\n    let sine = SineWave::new(conf.freq).take_duration(Duration::from_secs_f32(time));\n    sink.append(sine);\n    sink.sleep_until_end();\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nNote nvim_oxi::Function expects a Result return type, which we set to Infallible.\nWe generate an output stream to which we append a sine wave signal as long as the duration\nwe give the function. Because rodio's playback is asynchronous, we have to sleep until\nthe audio thread signals us it's done playing.\nBringing it all together\nFinally, we convert a buffer into dits and dahs. The function is all but efficient, and\nhas been written this way to increase code readability:\nfn convert(buf: Buffer, conf: Config) -&gt; Result&lt;(),Infallible&gt; {\n    let mut text: String = buf.get_lines(.., false).unwrap().fold(String::new(), |a,s| {a + &amp;s.to_string_lossy() + \"\\n\"});\n    text.pop();\n    let text = text.chars().map(|c| { match c {\n        'a' | 'A' =&gt; \".- \",\n        'b' | 'B' =&gt; \"-... \",\n        'c' | 'C' =&gt; \"-.-. \",\n        'd' | 'D' =&gt; \"-.. \",\n        'e' | 'E' =&gt; \". \",\n        'f' | 'F' =&gt; \"..-. \",\n        'g' | 'G' =&gt; \"--. \",\n        'h' | 'H' =&gt; \".... \",\n        'i' | 'I' =&gt; \".. \",\n        'j' | 'J' =&gt; \".--- \",\n        'k' | 'K' =&gt; \"-.- \",\n        'l' | 'L' =&gt; \".-.. \",\n        'm' | 'M' =&gt; \"-- \",\n        'n' | 'N' =&gt; \"-. \",\n        'o' | 'O' =&gt; \"--- \",\n        'p' | 'P' =&gt; \".--. \",\n        'q' | 'Q' =&gt; \"--.- \",\n        'r' | 'R' =&gt; \".-. \",\n        's' | 'S' =&gt; \"... \",\n        't' | 'T' =&gt; \"- \",\n        'u' | 'U' =&gt; \"..- \",\n        'v' | 'V' =&gt; \"...- \",\n        'w' | 'W' =&gt; \".-- \",\n        'x' | 'X' =&gt; \"-..- \",\n        'y' | 'Y' =&gt; \"-.-- \",\n        'z' | 'Z' =&gt; \"--.. \",\n        ' '       =&gt; \"/ \",\n        '\\n'      =&gt; \"-...- \",\n        _         =&gt; \"\"\n    }}).fold(String::new(), |a,s| {a + s });\n    for s in text.chars() {\n        let unit = 0.07;\n        match s {\n            '.' =&gt; {beep(unit, conf).unwrap(); sleep(Duration::from_secs_f32(unit));},\n            '-' =&gt; {beep(unit*3.0, conf).unwrap(); sleep(Duration::from_secs_f32(unit));},\n            '/' =&gt; {sleep(Duration::from_secs_f32(unit*2.0));},\n            ' ' =&gt; {sleep(Duration::from_secs_f32(unit));},\n            _   =&gt; {},\n        }\n    }\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWe first read the lines of the buffer and concatenate them. We then convert it to a \nstring of dots and dashes and convert those dots and dashes into beeps of the appropriate\nduration. For now, the unit duration is hard-coded, but I intend to set it as a setup option.\nAnd that's all for now. To review the entire code, and try it out for yourself, go see\nthe project's github page\nConclusion\nAs you can see, Using neovim in conjunction with Rust as a lua replacement is really\nnot that hard. There are a few abstractions lua forces us into, but it's only a matter of following\nneovim's API through nvim-oxi function calls.\n","id":"https://theycallmehacked.github.io/post/nvim-loves-rust/","title":"Nvim loves Rust: How I built a toy plug-in for neovim in Rust"},"https://theycallmehacked.github.io/post/openbsd-rust-part0/":{"body":"If you've been around the Rust community, you have probably heard the\ntrope \"rewrite it in Rust\". That's what we're gonna be doing today with\nOpenBSD's base system package.\nNotice:\nJust a note before we start: I am affiliated in no way with either the\nOpenBSD nor the Rust Projects or Foundations. I'm just a student who\nwants to have fun. Especially, don't harass OpenBSD developers to\ninclude any of my code: It's trash and they probably wont want to\ninclude it anyway (see Theo de Raadt's view on Rust).\nThis isn't a fork of OpenBSD either, but simply a way for me to toy\naround. Again, please treat everyone with respect.\nMotivation\nMy motivations are simple and mainly twofold:\n\nLearn Rust\nLearn OpenBSD\n\nThat's it. Now to get a bit more into the details: I want to get better\nat Rust. I have been fully convinced, that Rust, while far from a\nperfect language, is the direction modern Programming should go. And\nwhile I believe its \"no breaking changes\" policy is doomed to make it a\nbloated mess in about as much time as it took C++ to become said bloated\nmess, I still think Rust is a language to take inspiration from. And\ntherefore I want to deepen my experience with Rust's paradigm. And I\nwant to better understand OpenBSD. Why OpenBSD? Because GNU has become\ntoo complex for little me to handle, BusyBox is a single executable\nmaking it harder to convert piece by piece, and I simply love the idea\nof the OpenBSD project. My long term goal would be to maybe contribute\nto OpenBSD, but I would first like to familiarise myself with its code\nbase. And what better way to do it than to rewrite it in an other\nlanguage. Hell I might discover bugs this way, that I may report\nupstream (unlikely considering I barely understand what an allocator is\nand does).\nAlso note I will probably only \"maintain\" (if at all) the amd64 version.\nIt may or may not be possible to build any part of what I'm doing on\nother architectures, especially i386, but I will neither guarantee nor\neven test it.\nObjectives\nThe main goal of this endeavour is to have functional clones of at least\nsome of the binaries in OpenBSD's base package. Considering that it\ncontains 775 executables (not counting shared libraries) as of writing\nthis, I can obviously not rewrite every single one of them. I will try\nmy best efforts to clone the most useful ones first.\nNote I know the existence of uutils coreutils\nbut\n\nthey implement the GNU coreutils, not OpenBSD base system\nI still want to build my own thing out of fun.\n\nAs for a road map, let's try to follow this:\n\n\nrebuild all of /bin except sh, csh and (r)ksh\n\n\n[\n\ncat\n\nchgrp\n\nchio\n\nchmod\n\ncksum\n\ncp\n\ncpio\n\ncsh\n\ndate\n\ndd\n\ndf\n\ndomainname\n\necho\n\ned\n\neject\n\nexpr\n\nhostname\n\nkill\n\nln\n\nls\n\nmd5\n\nmkdir\n\nmt\n\nmv\n\npax\n\nps\n\npwd\n\nrm\n\nrmdir\n\nsha1\n\nsha256\n\nsha512\n\nsleep\n\nstty\n\nsync\n\ntar\n\ntest\n\n\n\nrebuild all of /sbin\n\n\natactl\n\nbadsect\n\nbioctl\n\nchown\n\nclri\n\ndhclient\n\ndhcpleased\n\ndisklabel\n\ndmesg\n\ndump\n\ndumpfs\n\nfdisk\n\nfsck\n\nfsck_ext2fs\n\nfsck_ffs\n\nfsck_msdos\n\nfsdb\n\nfsirand\n\ngrowfs\n\nhalt\n\nifconfig\n\niked\n\ninit\n\nipsecctl\n\nisakmpd\n\nkbd\n\nldattach\n\nldconfig\n\nmkfifo\n\nmknod\n\nmount\n\nmount_cd9660\n\nmountd\n\nmount_ext2fs\n\nmount_ffs\n\nmount_mfs\n\nmount_msdos\n\nmount_nfs\n\nmount_ntfs\n\nmount_tmpfs\n\nmount_udf\n\nmount_vnd\n\nncheck\n\nncheck_ffs\n\nnewfs\n\nnewfs_ext2fs\n\nnewfs_msdos\n\nnfsd\n\nnologin\n\npfctl\n\npflogd\n\nping\n\nping6\n\nquotacheck\n\nrdump\n\nreboot\n\nresolvd\n\nrestore\n\nroute\n\nrrestore\n\nsavecore\n\nscan_ffs\n\nscsi\n\nshutdown\n\nslaacd\n\nswapctl\n\nswapon\n\nsysctl\n\nttyflags\n\ntunefs\n\numount\n\nunwind\n\nvnconfig\n\nwsconsctl\nThis road map will be update as I progress in my endeavour.

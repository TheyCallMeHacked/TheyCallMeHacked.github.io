Hey, I'm Alex. I'm just some student from France (although I'm currently in
Iceland for an Erasmus year). I'm just here rambling about my different passions
including but not limited to programming (mostly) useless stuff and doing some
approximate photography. Hope you'll like it here.

Posts will be in different languages (French, English, or German, maybe
Icelandic if I get to learn it well enough), depending on how I feel inspired. I
will sort it at some point, but it is not my priority right now.
